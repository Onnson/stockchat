# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing the clarification feature to handle ambiguous stock queries and data validation issues.

## What we're working on now
1. **Clarification Feature Implementation**
   - Backend clarification endpoint and service implemented
   - Frontend API client and UI components in progress
   - Handling async validation for stock data
   - Fixing TypeScript/React dependency issues

2. **Current Issues**
   - React type declarations missing in frontend
   - Async/await implementation needs refinement in backend
   - Need to properly handle stock data validation

3. **Technical Challenges**
   - Stock data validation for insufficient data
   - Async operations in FastAPI endpoints
   - TypeScript type definitions and React dependencies

## Recent Changes
- Added clarification models and endpoints
- Implemented stock data validation
- Created frontend UI components for clarification flow
- Added API client methods for clarification requests

## Next Steps
1. Fix frontend dependency issues:
   - Install missing React type declarations
   - Update TypeScript configuration
   - Resolve component type errors

2. Refine backend implementation:
   - Make `get_clarifications` properly async
   - Improve error handling for stock data validation
   - Add comprehensive logging

3. Add test coverage:
   - Unit tests for clarification endpoints
   - Integration tests for the complete flow
   - Edge case testing for data validation

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank initialization
- Documentation review

## Next Steps
1. Await confirmation of memory bank accuracy
2. Request information about any current development priorities
3. Identify specific areas needing attention or improvement

Note: This file should be updated with more specific information once current development priorities are provided.

## What we're working on now
1. **Preliminary Q&A Stage**  
   - Implement an interactive Q&A to confirm or refine a user's request before final analysis.

2. **Drilldown/Follow-up for Analysis Sections**  
   - Allow the user to ask deeper questions about general Analysis, Technical Analysis, or Fundamental Analysis.  
   - Provide an expanded UI/UX flow for these deeper inquiries.

3. **DexScreener Integration**  
   - Investigate and begin a basic on-chain analytics module.  
   - Target immediate use cases like retrieving DeFi token data or liquidity pair stats.

## Recent changes
- Currently, no direct code or UI changes have been committed for these features. We are still in the planning phase.

## Next steps
1. Design the Q&A logic with DSPy to parse partial queries and generate clarifying prompts.  
2. Implement a "drilldown" UI component on the frontend that can send follow-up queries (plus context) to the backend.  
3. Prototype DexScreener data fetchingâ€”decide on data fields (volume, TVL, liquidity) and how to integrate them with TA-Lib or DSPy if needed.
